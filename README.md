This is a site that contains five .HTML pages: Home, About, Projects, and Connect. The fifth page can be viewed by submitting text in the input fields of the Connect page.
All pages are styled with a single .CSS file. 

Home: Linked in the NavBar as an anchored image "logo". Introductory page to the site, I would eventually like to make this a full page slideshow of work images. 
About: Linked in the NavBar as "About". Picture of my face in a scanner bed, followed by introductory text. Two UL lists: Intro & Skills. Accounts buttons link to personal work pages.
Projects: Linked in the NavBar as "Projects". UL list placeholders for written content about projects.
Connect: Linked in the NavBar as "Connect". Three input fields accept text: Name, Email, and a textarea: Inquiry.
Sumbmission Redirect Page: Temporary landing page after clicking "submit" button. Displays text, and a cheeky GIF. After 5 seconds, user is bounced to Home page. 

This site uses two .JS files to direct site traffic upon clicking "submit" in the Connect page.
